        During this technological era, a number of advancements have been made 
        to facilitate ease of meeting persons for the sole benefit of forming 
        partnerships. It was with this in mind where the development of 
        <b>Compatibility Score Index </b> stemmed. <br>
        It is our passion to go beyond the outer features of a person and 
        focus on his/her unique attributes for the purpose of providing an 
        accurate and yet efficient system. <br>
        Our system seeks to present to 
        the user a set of compatible persons based on 
        <b>Age,
        Gender,
        Height,
        Hobby,
        Ethnicity,
        Personality Type,
        Leadership Style,
        Education Level and
        Occupation	</b>;
        instead of focusing solely on the outer appearances to determine 
        compatibility. It is desired that this will assist in breaking down 
        the barriers of accessible matching for future generations.
        <br>
        From CSI, came <b>Réseau</b>, the web application that will assist users
        with all these aspects.

      An organizer is an individual who organizes groups.
      Organizers are able to create sets and form groups within them.
      These groups are generated from a list 
      of compatible persons or even non-compatible persons if 
      they so desire. <br> <br>
      After the creation of these groups, the organizer can 
      then view the groups as mentioned above, as well as manage each group 
      by being able to make changes to each if necessary.

      A regular user enters the necessary information about themselves in order 
      to generate a list of other users who fall under compatible and/or non-compatible
      in relation to them. From this list the user may pin/add that user to their list of
      friends as well as view the breakdown of compatibility among those persons. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, this user will aslo be allowed to join sets formed by organizers
      once given the 'group code' and be placed in groups.
