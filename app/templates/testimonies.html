                I received a survey from team CSI in which I was asked about my own features
                as well as features I may prefer in a companion/friend. I really liked that they 
                considered factors as education and work field in relation to a perfect companion.
                Never seen another application go to this extent before.

            I admired the process Team CSI went thru in order to gain the appropriate 
            knowledge about me. It really gave me hope about this application; that it 
            could possibly provide me with the best of the best when it comes to 
            persons I’m compatible with.

              Team CSI have shown me that there exists modern applications out there 
              that care about more than the physical appearance or whether I 
              ‘swiped right’ or ‘swiped left’ on someone’s photo. 
              They considered my hobbies and work area and I really appreciated that.

                What else is there to say about this other than it’s the next best thing! 
                Knowing the process this team of developers went thru to create the best 
                matching app makes the application 10x as useful that any other. Plus 
                it’s local, Jamaicans needed something like this!
